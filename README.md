# React.js front-end with c# back-end app

### Website is with minimal ui elements that are required
There is a nav bar with home and add buttons.  
When you are on add page there is a form to add a note.  
When you are on the main page you can view all notes or individual note by clicking on it.

### The back-end part is not configured with a database instead I am using a json file as a mock database
